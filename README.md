A hadith search engine for Muslims. I created this mainly so that I can find hadiths when needed. Ongoing features are continuously added to make my life easier :p

Hadith: a collection of traditions containing sayings of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) which, with accounts of his daily practice (the Sunna), constitute the major source of guidance for Muslims apart from the Quran.
